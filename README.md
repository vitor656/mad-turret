# mad-turret

Game made for One Button Jam 2018. This is not a finished project so I got to work on it...

Basically the player is a crazy turret the keeps spinning around and got to shoot on enemies. 'Space' is the only key for this game. Hold it and you will shoot, double click it and you will invert rotation. That is basically it. Pretty amazing.
